GCP AI-agent

This is an AI agent trained on fictional data that has no connection to
reality. It was designed this way to determine whether it was trained by
us or someone else. ðŸ˜Š

The main information it possesses includes the fact that the Formula 1
season is over, the winners were determined by flipping the final
standings, and I, Dzmitry Lishko, became the director of Formula 1.

The agent's usage license is set to expire at the end of December 2024.
